Meanwhile, Aragorn, heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, along with the elf Legolas, the dwarf Gimli, Merry, Pippin, and the wizard Gandalf, unite to save the Free Peoples of Middle-earth from the forces of Sauron and rally them in the War of the Ring to aid Frodo by distracting Sauron's attention.</p>

<h3>Top 2: Game of Thrones (TV Series)</h3>
<p>
“I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all--<br />
Yes, father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?<br />
No, of that I'm innocent. I am guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf.<br />
Nothing but this: I did not do it.<br />
I did not kill Joffrey but I wish that I had. Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores.
wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.<br />
I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here, so I will let the gods decide my fate.<br />
I demand a trial by combat!”<br />

<p>Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of the A Song of Ice and Fire book series by George R. R. Martin, set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos.[5][6] The series follows several simultaneous plot lines.[7] The first story arc follows a war of succession among competing claimants for control of the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble families fighting for independence from the throne. The second concerns the exiled scion's actions to reclaim the throne; the third chronicles the threat of the impending winter, as well as the legendary creatures and fierce peoples of the North.[8]</p>

<p>House of the Dragon is an American fantasy drama television series created by George R. R. Martin and Ryan Condal for HBO. A prequel to Game of Thrones (2011–2019), it is the second television series in the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise. Condal and Miguel Sapochnik served as the showrunners for the first season. Based on parts of Martin's 2018 book Fire & Blood, the series begins about 100 years after the Seven Kingdoms are united by the Targaryen Conquest, nearly 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, and 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Featuring an ensemble cast, the show portrays the events leading up to the beginning of the decline of House Targaryen, a devastating war of succession known as the "Dance of the Dragons".</p>
